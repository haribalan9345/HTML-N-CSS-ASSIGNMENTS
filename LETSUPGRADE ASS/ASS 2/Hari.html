        The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
        HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
        HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.</pre>

    <h1> CSS </h1>
    <pre>
        CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. 
        It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens,
        small screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language.</pre>

    <h1> JAVASCRIPT </h1>
    <pre class="Hari">
        JavaScript (often shortened to JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class functions, 
        and is best known as the scripting language for Web pages, but it's used in many non-browser environments as well.
        JavaScript can function as both a procedural and an object oriented language
